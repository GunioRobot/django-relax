A little about the project
==========================

`django-relax`_ is a Django application designed to simplify the task of
integrating the `Django web framework`_ with `Apache CouchDB`_ databases. It
accomplishes this by providing several utilities useful to tasks involving
both systems, running the gamut from database compaction to replication and
deployment of pre-made fixtures.

Current status
==============

`django-relax`_ is in a planning/alpha stage and is not considered stable or
suitable for deployment on production systems. However, if you are interested
in contributing, you can try it out on development systems to help contribute
feedback. Feedback at the moment can only be done via the `django-relax wiki`,
but I'm looking to find some issue-tracker hosting, etc.
